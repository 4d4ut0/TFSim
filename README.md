# Tomasulo-Algorithm-Simulator

Event-driven simulation of the Tomasulo Algorithm using the C++ interface SystemC, with a complete GUI.

The purpose of this project is to ease the teaching of this algorithm, deemed extremely important to the understanding of
out-of-order execution on modern microprocessors.
